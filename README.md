> How can I control my **SMartBoards**?

**SMartBoards** can be controlled via `Alexa` using voice commands, via `Web App` using any browser from your computer, mobile or tablet, or via the `SMartBoards` iOS app (coming very soon!). 

**SMartBoards** can be also controlled via `MQTT` and works with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) and other similar MQTT-enabled services.

**SMartBoards** can send you push notifications using the [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) service.
